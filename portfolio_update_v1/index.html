        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m an aspiring UX designer looking to add web development to my list of skillsets. Although I have acheived success in my early career, I felt there was still so much more to learn and decided to embrace being a student once again.</p>
        <p>I enjoy learning how everyday things are built, and look to combine this passion with my interest in art and organization to produce beautiful elements people will enjoy using and sharing.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I aim to familiarize myself with the process of building websites, and increase my knowledge in:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
          <li>Rails</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once I have gained the knowledge needed to construct beautiful websites, I would like to work with meaningful nonprofit organizations to create an experience in which users are engaged and eager to get involved!</p>
